# Simple Sudoku Game

## Written in [Processing](https://processing.org/)

## Installation

I am not providing any binaries so you will need to download a recent version
of [Processing](https://processing.org/download/)

After that you can either launch the editor and open the sketch or use the
command-line utility they provide

Either way, this is meant to be played on a portrait mode device
